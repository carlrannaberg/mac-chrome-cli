## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to v1.0.0

The v1.0.0 release includes breaking changes due to the service-oriented architecture refactoring. Most users won't need to make changes as the CLI interface remains the same, but developers extending the codebase should note:

#### Breaking Changes
- Internal architecture completely restructured from monolithic to service-oriented
- Error handling now uses unified Result<T,E> pattern instead of direct exceptions
- Service dependencies now managed through dependency injection container

#### API Compatibility
- All CLI commands maintain identical interfaces and behavior
- JSON output formats remain unchanged
- Global options (--json, --timeout, --window) work as before

#### New Features Available
- Enhanced error messages with recovery hints
- Improved performance across all operations
- Better security with input sanitization
- Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

## Security Advisories

### SA-2025-001: Directory Traversal Prevention
**Severity:** High  
**Affected Versions:** < 1.0.0  
**Fixed In:** 1.0.0  

Early versions did not properly validate file paths in upload operations, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks. The security layer added in v1.0.0 includes comprehensive path validation.

**Mitigation:** Upgrade to v1.0.0 or later.

## Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux) via different automation backends
- Enhanced network monitoring with HAR export capabilities
- Visual regression testing integration
- Parallel execution support for test automation
- Plugin system for extensible command development

### Known Issues
- AppleScript requires Chrome to be the active application for some operations
- File upload only supports single file selection currently
- Network monitoring doesn't capture WebSocket message contents
