# Actual Command Test Results - HONEST ASSESSMENT

## Testing Date: August 23, 2025

## Test Environment
- Chrome: Running (2 windows, 40+ tabs)
- macOS: 14.4.1
- Permissions: AppleScript ✅, Screen Recording ✅

## ACTUAL Test Results

### ✅ Commands That Actually Work

1. **Core Commands**
   - `test` - ✅ Works
   - `doctor` - ✅ Works
   - `wait` - ✅ Works (with some logging output mixed in JSON)
   - `meta info/stats/commands/permissions` - ✅ All work

2. **Tab Management**
   - `tab list` - ✅ Works (returns list of 40 tabs)
   - `tab active` - ✅ Works (returns active tab info)

3. **Screenshots**
   - `shot viewport` - ✅ Works (creates 4MB PNG file)
   - `shot window` - ✅ Likely works (same mechanism)

4. **Help System**
   - All `--help` commands - ✅ Work (provide documentation)

### ❌ Commands That Are FAILING

1. **Navigation Commands**
   - `nav go` - ❌ FAILS: "Access not allowed" AppleScript error
   - `nav reload` - ❌ FAILS: Same AppleScript access issue
   - `nav back/forward` - ❌ FAILS: Same issue

2. **DOM Evaluation**
   - `dom eval` - ❌ FAILS: "Access not allowed" when trying to execute JavaScript

3. **Page Snapshots**
   - `snapshot outline` - ❌ FAILS: Can't execute JavaScript to extract DOM
   - `snapshot dom-lite` - ❌ FAILS: Same JavaScript execution issue

4. **Scrolling**
   - `scroll position` - ❌ FAILS: Can't execute JavaScript to get position
   - `scroll to/by` - ❌ FAILS: JavaScript execution blocked

5. **Network Monitoring**
   - `netlog start/stop/dump` - ❌ FAILS: JavaScript injection blocked

6. **Form Input**
   - `input fill` - ❌ Likely fails (uses JavaScript injection)

7. **File Operations**
   - `files upload/dragdrop` - ❌ Likely fails (JavaScript based)

## Root Cause

**The main issue is AppleScript/Chrome JavaScript execution permissions.**

Error pattern:
```
"Can't get [JavaScript code] in targetTab. Access not allowed. (-1723)"
```

This appears to be a Chrome security restriction preventing AppleScript from executing JavaScript in Chrome tabs.

## What This Means

### Working Features (30%)
- Basic CLI infrastructure ✅
- Tab enumeration/info ✅
- Screenshots ✅
- Help/documentation ✅

### Broken Features (70%)
- Page navigation ❌
- DOM manipulation ❌
- JavaScript execution ❌
- Form interaction ❌
- Network monitoring ❌
- Scrolling control ❌
- File uploads ❌

## Conclusion

**The CLI is only partially functional.** While the infrastructure is solid and some commands work, the core browser automation features that rely on JavaScript execution are broken due to Chrome/AppleScript permission restrictions.

This is a **critical implementation issue** that affects the majority of the advertised functionality.
